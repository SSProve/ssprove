In this file we pack pairs of free probabilistic computations into a
(order enriched) relative monad instance (see ord_relativeMonad).

Some informations about free monads:

The unary Free monad can be parametrized by a collection of operations S
and arities for those operations (somth of type S -> choiceType).
Concretely S could be the collection {(sample_bollean p) | p in [01]}, ie
one Bernouilli sampling operation for each probability p. In this case
the arity predicate (ar : S -> choiceType) would map each operation to bool
(or rather the choiceType instance for bool).
Indeed we expect the environment to either return true or false after
a Bernouilli sampling operation has been issued to it.

We take S = { X: choice_type & SDistr X }, that is, each subdistribution
sampling from a choiceType present in choice_type (a small universe of choiceTypes)
is considered as being part of our probabilistic signature (S,P)
where P : S -> choiceType is the first projection.


NOTE regarding ancient design:

Note that before we were specifying a probabilistic operation with
an ITree like event type
Inductive probE : Type -> Type :=
  |Bern : unit_interval R -> probE bool
  |Poisson : (λ : unit_interval R) → probE nat.
The parameter of the inductive is supposed to be the type of the valued
returned by the environment after an operation has been issued. The
parameters of the constructors are supposed to represent the information
we would like to pass when we issue an operation. For instance when
sampling uniformly a boolean we need to provide a probability p : [O,1].
We were using this last way of specifying sampling operations generically
and we were translating this signature
internally into a collection of operations S and an
arity predicate ar : S -> choiceType
